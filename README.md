Stacking Letters

Create a stackLetters function that should console.log() rows of letters. It should take an array containing the letters of the alphabet and output them in the developer console.

a
ab
abc
abcd
abcde
abcdef
etc...
Starter code for alpha-stackers.js
// Create an array that contains the letters of the alphabet
var alphabet = [];

// The stackLetter function should accept the array as the sole argument
function stackLetters (theAlphabetArray) {
    /*
      Write a `for` loop that iterates over the array argument and
      outputs the letters.
     */
}

// Invoke the function and pass in the array
stackLetters(alphabet)
Adding Conditions to the Loop

Then add logic to stackLetters that places a space after every third letter. This will require you to do some basic math in JavaScript, and use an if statement.

Your job is to read the following English statement and write the equivalent in JavaSript code to make it work.

If the current value of the counter variable can be evenly divided by 3 - using the JavaScript remainder operator - then add a single space to the output.
a
ab
abc
abc d
abc de
abc def
abc def g
abc def gh
abc def ghi
etc...
